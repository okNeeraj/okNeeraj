## ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, I'm Neeraj Singh, Frontend Developer from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India ðŸ‘‹
A frontend developer with a passion for creating beautiful, reactive and intuitive user interfaces. With several years of experience in web development, 
I have honed my skills in Javascript, NodeJs, ReactJs, HTML and CSS/SCSS to build responsive, accessible, interactive and mobile-first websites.

I'm particularly interested in user experience design and always strive to create interfaces that are both visually appealing and easy to use. 
In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen eye for design and enjoy collaborating with designers to turn their visions into functional websites.

I'm also familiar with build tools like Webpack and Vite and have used them to optimize site performance.

My goal as a frontend developer is to make the web a more beautiful and accessible place. 
I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me in this constantly evolving industry.
